This is a fun little project for me to explore data involving UFC fights in the men's divsion.
I used Python with the following libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Note: the plotly interactive line graph doesn't work on github but works in the Notebook itself if you download. 
I added the png version from my own notebook.
